- "I have heard more than one LISP advocate state such subjective
comments as, "LISP is the most powerful and elegant programming
language in the world" and expect such comments to be taken as
objective truth. I have never heard a Java, C++, C, Perl, or
Python advocate make the same claim about their own language of
choice."

- "As computers have grown more powerful, the new languages being
eveloped have been moving steadily toward the Lisp model. A popular
recipe for new programming languages in the past 20 years has been
to take the C model of computing and add to it, piecemeal, parts
taken from Lisp."    
-- Paul Graham
